Hello I am **Pranav Varma**.I am from **Mumbai**.I am currently studying in **IIT GOA CSE branch**.      
    <br>
    My favourite hobby is *travelling* because I love discovering new cities and places around the world.
    I often save up for months to plan a trip every year. 
    <br>
    I love friends trips and *family* outings but solo travelling brings me the real adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.‚Äù
    I like spending time in nature and capture all the wonderful moments of beauty with my camera.
    <br>
    I have been doing nature **photography** since I was in school and is the best hobby I think I am truly proud of.
    My best hobby is meditating and spending my free time at meditation retreats.
    <br>
    I think it has really helped me understand my mind and its **complexities** and in ensuring a better mental wellbeing.
    <br>
    Composing **music** and **songwriting** have been my favourite pastime since I was in high school.
    I have my own **garage band** with a few of my high school classmates and we spend our free weekends and holidays **composing** **new tunes** and performing at open clubs.
